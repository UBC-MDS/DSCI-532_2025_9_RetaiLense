# Milestone 3 Reflection

## What We Have Implemented So Far

Our dashboard still follows our app original design, however with a few modifications. We still have followed the general layout of our sketch, with four main charts and supporting widgets that provide insights from our data:

-   Net revenue sales by month through a trend-line chart.
-   Monthly revenue by product through a bar chart.
-   Updated stacked bar chart to record sales and returns.
-   Updated interactive pie chart of top-performing international markets (outside the UK).
-   Interactive cards summarizing important business insights like the company's net sales and loyal customer ratio.
-   Updated title and sidebar styling
-   Updated chart colours to align with eachother
-   Updated formatting on display cards
-   **Challenging question attempt:**

## Deviations from the Original Sketch

Our biggest deviation was transitioning from a static pie chart to an interactive one. The pie chart still highlights the top-performing international markets outside of the UK, however it is now also linked to the global filters. Users can click on a country within the pie chart, which updates the country filter and refreshes the dashboard accordingly.All other non-UK countries are aggregated into an "Others" category, which also updates the dashboard when selected. Clicking outside the pie chart resets the global filter to its default, displaying data for the United Kingdom.

Based on feedback, we also replaced the waterfall chart with a more intuitive stacked bar chart. While still conveying key insights into sales and returns, this format enhances readability and user experience.

Lastly, we rearranged the order of our charts to create a more logical flow and improve usability. The top charts focus on revenue and overall sales, while the lower charts provide deeper insights into top products and customer distribution. This adjustment realigns with our original sketch, reversing last weeks decision to reorder the layout.

## Current Issues with the Dashboard

Re-organizing the Dashboard layout created another conflict with the pie chart labels cutting off. We will work to find an improvement for this next week.

## Deviations from Best Practices

## Strengths

The strength of our dashboard lies in its clear presentation of key insights and logical flow. Users can easily analyze product and sales patterns across all operating countries. The interactive pie chart is now one of the dashboards standout features, providing a quick view of the top five international markets while also allowing users to explore data for all other regions.

## Future Improvements and Additions

We are continuously working on enhancing the dashboard to make it as visually appealing and user-friendly as possible:

-   Continue to improve dashboard aesthetics. Specifically, we need to decide if we want to keep the pastel theme for our charts or change it.
-   As mentioned earlier, re-organizing the Dashboard layout created another conflict with the pie chart labels cutting off. We will work to find an improvement for this next week.
-   Discuss appropriate chart names and title formats
-   Address peer-review feedback
