# Milestone 2 Reflection

## What We Have Implemented So Far

Our dashboard closely follows our app design and implements all the components we had planned. We have created four main charts and supporting widgets that provide insights from our data:

* Net revenue sales by month through a trend-line chart.
* Monthly revenue by product through a bar chart.
* A waterfall chart to record sales and returns.
* A pie chart of top-performing international markets (countries outside the UK).
* Interactive cards summarizing important business insights like the company's net sales and loyal customer ratio.
* All charts except the pie chart are bound by two global filtersâ€”date range and country dropdown.

## Deviations from the Original Sketch

At this time, we have implemented all our originally planned features. We changed our monthly revenue chart from a bar chart to a trend-line chart as it is more intuitive. We have also added a footer section to provide a quick summary of the dashboard's functionality. Additionally, we experimented with the placement of the cards and global filters and arrived at a more visually appealing template for now.

## Current Issues with the Dashboard

We are continuously working on improving the aesthetics and layout of the dashboard. Since different group members created various app elements, the dashboard lacks consistency and alignment. We also want to implement enhancements to improve functionality and provide better business insights at a glance.

## Deviations from Best Practices

Our dashboard does not clearly indicate which filter interacts with which chart. Currently, our country filter defaults to the UK, and selecting all countries at once is tedious. We will consider adding an option to select all countries with a single click. Moreover, all our scripts are in the same Python file, and we plan to modularize our code next week.

## Strengths

Our dashboard effectively covers important business insights. The cards provide key statistics at a glance, and the choice of charts for each use case is intuitive. The global filters also work well for generating insights. This dashboard serves as a strong foundation for a more comprehensive version we may develop in the future.

## Future Improvements and Additions

As mentioned earlier, we are working on enhancing the dashboard's aesthetics to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly:

* Add date range filters to the pie chart and cards for consistency.
* Reorder the charts to improve storytelling.
